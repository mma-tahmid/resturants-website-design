# Important Information about this project
Figma file are accurately implemented in the React code. 
I used Tailwind CSS Framework 
Break down the design into reusable React components, matching the structure and hierarchy of elements in the Figma file.
Use CSS (or a CSS-in-JS library like styled-components) to style each component according to the Figma specifications, ensuring pixel-perfect alignment and responsiveness.

Integrate any required functionality, including navigation, animations, and interactivity, using React hooks and other React features.

Continuously test the design in different screen sizes to maintain consistency with the Figma design, adjusting styles as needed for responsiveness

Layout Structure: Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to match the layout structure precisely as in the Figma design.

Responsive Design: Ensure that the components and layout are responsive to different screen sizes, as specified in the design.

Routing (if needed): Set up routing with react-router-dom for a multi-page layout or navigation.
